    <h4>Week 1 - Introduction to Web Development</h4>

    <img id = "image1" src="Cat.jpeg" alt="Cat" class="center">

    <ul>
      <li>During Week 1, I learnt about what does developers do and i started coding using hmtl and created my very first webpage.</li>
      <li>I learnt about the common HTML5 Elements: p, h1-h6, em, strong. Some other html tags includes eg, h1, p, ol, ul, img, article, section etc</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>

    <h4>Week 2 - Semantics & CSS</h4>

    <ul>
      <li>During Week 2, I learnt about more HTML5 Elements: header, nav, article, section. These tag's purpose are to present our webpage into a much more organised manner where as when a problem/error occurs, it is much easier to locate.</li>
      <li>Some other common elements includes: table, details, figure, form, aside, mark, main.</li>
      <li>I learnt things like ID attribute and Class attribute which are essential in targetting an individual or a group. This means that if you want to make that specific tag to be different from others either by adding a different color, font, or text size and etc. This way, by having either the ID or Class attribute, it will help to specifially edit and modify the text/content.</li>
      <li>Additionally, I also learnt about the CSS3 Web Gradients which just helps to make any webpage look nicer and appealing.</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>

    <h4>Week 3 - Forms & Advance CSS Layouts</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>During Week 3, I learnt about how to using HTML Forms, Selectors, Colors, Positioning, Media Queries and Flexbox.</li>
      <li>I learnt the some new elements: form, input and label. The input tag creates an interactive control eg: text, date, checkbox, radio, etc. Label are important for making the webpage much more assessible for the user when doing the form for example, they would be asked to put an option out of a few of their liking/preference. Another thing is validations in form. They are used to make sure that an input is not left empty by the user and is required for the user to fill up. If the option that has a validation and is left empty, users will be prompted to fill it with an input.</li>
      <li>I learnt about the Nested elements & the DOM. An example is the section tag is the parent element of h1, p and ul whereby these 3 tags are considered 'siblings' and li tag is the 'children' of ul tag and descendant of section. However it is recommended that it is best to use at most 3 levels with descendant selectors, if too many is used it might get complicated and confusing when coding in future. The usage of '!important' keyword can be used to override source order and specificity. It can be added just before the end of the rule declaration before the semicolon of the stylesheet, however one must keep in mind that the '!important' keyword might get confusing in the long run as to override this keyword is by using another same keyword.</li>
      <li>Next, in order to modify the CSS of a site depending on qualities for example device type or viewport size.</li>
      <li>Lastly, Flexbox is used to simplify the process of creating flexible and responsive layouts, especially compared to older layout techniques like floats and tables. It allows you to control the alignment, direction, and size of elements with just a few lines of CSS. Other pros are that it is inherently responsive, adjusting layouts seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices. In other words, here are the common uses of Flexbox: Creating navigation bars and menus, Building flexible grids and galleries, Aligning items within forms and cards, Creating responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes, Crafting complex nested layouts with ease.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Week 4 - Responsive Images and Spilt UI</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>In Week 4, I learnt that responsive images in HTML are used to allows images to adapt to different screen sizes and devices, ensuring optimal viewing experiences and faster loading times across various platforms.</li>
      <li>Visual Consistency: Responsive images maintain their proportions and clarity on different screens, preventing distortion, cropping, or blurriness. This ensures a cohesive and professional look across devices.
        Performance Optimization: Responsive techniques avoid loading unnecessarily large images on smaller screens, reducing data usage and speeding up page load times. This leads to a better user experience and potential SEO benefits.
        Improved User Experience: Faster loading speeds, clear visuals, and consistent layouts across devices enhance user satisfaction and engagement.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Week 5 - Art of Learning Javascirpt</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>During this Whitespace week, students were tasked to review and complete the quizes in LinkedIn and upload the screenshots.</li>
      <li>I learnt about variables, which holds all sorts of data, from text to numbers. Strings are like sequences of building blocks, letters, numbers and special characters. Then i understood how JavaScript handles calculations and numerical data. These are some examples of the things i learnt in this week.</li>

    <h4>Week 6 - Javascript, Objects and DOM</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>In Week 6, I learnt that 'let' is a tool for creating name tags for data. It introduces variables, containers that store information like text, numbers, or user input. They are essential for tracking and manipulating data within webpages.</li>
      <li>For loops are used to iterate a set number of times and they are often used to process arrays or lists.</li>
      <li>While loops keep going as long as a condition is true and it is useful for user input or waiting for things like events.</li>
      <li>Lastly, I have learnt how to use these elements in HTML JavaScript code lives within script tags: It is embedded within HTML documents, ready to interact with elements on the page.
        'let' variables store data: They can hold user input from forms, results of calculations, or any information needed for dynamic behaviour.
        Loops automate tasks: They can update content, create animations, or perform actions based on changing conditions.
        Functions handle specific tasks: They might validate form data, fetch content from servers, create interactive elements, or generate visual effects.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Week 7 - DOM, Events & Local Storage</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>In Week 7, I learnt that HTML paints the static picture of a web page, but DOM, events, and local storage bring it to life. DOM provides the building blocks, events allow user interaction, and JavaScript acts as the choreographer, manipulating the DOM in response. Local storage adds a memory, persisting preferences and data even after closing the page. Together, they transform static HTML into interactive experiences, letting you build dynamic web applications and keep users engaged.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <hr><br>

    <h4>Week 8 - Fetch jQuery</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>In Week 8, I learnt that jQuery doesn't have a specific "Fetch" function, its robust AJAX methods like 'span class="math-inline"\.ajax\(\)\' and convenient shortcuts like `.get()` empower you to retrieve data from servers asynchronously. These methods handle various request types, which allows us to send data to the server and receive a response without refreshing the page. It lets us build dynamic web experiences where user interaction triggers data exchanges behind the scenes, enriching our applications and keeping users engaging. jQuery's AJAX methods come with benefits like cross-browser compatibility and seamless integration with other features like DOM manipulation and event handling, making them flexible and powerful tools for fetching data in our web projects.</li>
      <li>I also learnt the terms Data Attribute and API during this week. Data attributes are used to store custom data private to the page or application. They provide a way to embed custom data private to the page or application that can be used by JavaScript or CSS. Data attributes are prefixed with "data-" and can be added to any HTML element.</li>
      <li>APIs in HTML usually refer to the JavaScript APIs that browsers provide to interact with different aspects of a web page or to communicate with external services. Common APIs include the DOM (Document Object Model) API, which allows manipulation of HTML and XML documents, and the Fetch API, which is used for making HTTP requests.</li>
      <li>All in all, data attributes allow us to embed custom data in HTML elements, while APIs enable communication and interaction with external services. Combining data attributes with APIs can help create dynamic and personalised web applications. </li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <h4>Week 9 - Bootstrap</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>In Week 9, I learnt that Bootstrap serves as a powerful front-end framework, offering pre-designed components and styles that expedite the development of responsive, mobile-first websites and web applications. It not only saves time but also ensures a consistent and appealing look across diverse devices. With features such as a flexible grid system, pre-built components for example navigation bars, buttons, forms, cards, and customizable typography, Bootstrap provides a solid foundation for web design. Complementing this, charts play a crucial role in visually representing numerical data, aiding in the comprehension of patterns and trends.</li>
      <li>I also learnt that when both is used together, Bootstrap establishes the overall structure and styling of the webpage, creating containers for elements like charts. Meanwhile, chart libraries fetch and render data within this Bootstrap-styled HTML framework. Hence, it offers benefits like responsive design, enhanced data communication, and customisation options which makes them ideal for diverse applications.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Week 12 - RESTDB & NoSQL</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>In Week 12, i was taught about the concepts of RESTful databases (RestDB) and NoSQL have emerged as pivotal elements, reshaping the way data is managed and accessed in HTML applications. This reflection aims to unravel the significance of RestDB and NoSQL within the context of HTML, shedding light on their roles in modern web development.</li>
      <li>RestDB, short for RESTful Databases, epitomizes a paradigm shift in how web applications communicate with databases. The term "RESTful" stands for Representational State Transfer, a set of principles that guide the design of networked applications. In the context of RestDB, this entails a standardized approach to creating, reading, updating, and deleting data via HTTP methods, mirroring the CRUD operations.

        The essence of RestDB lies in its simplicity and adherence to REST principles, fostering a stateless communication model. As I incorporate RestDB into my HTML projects, the clean and intuitive API endpoints streamline data interactions, promoting a seamless connection between the front-end and the database. This aligns with the ethos of REST, making my applications more scalable, maintainable, and interoperable. As I integrate NoSQL databases into my HTML projects, I appreciate the agility they bring to the development process. The absence of rigid schemas empowers me to adapt to changing requirements without the constraints of predefined table structures. This flexibility proves invaluable when dealing with diverse data formats within HTML applications, allowing for efficient storage and retrieval of information.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Week 13 - Best Practises & Common Mistakes</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>In Week 13, I learnt that in the realm of web development, reflecting on common mistakes from Assignment 1 provides invaluable insights into areas that require attention and improvement. Simultaneously, incorporating proactive tips can serve as a guide for future projects, enhancing overall project management and documentation. Here are some common mistakes: File naming and linking problems hinder project accessibility and collaboration. Solution: Adopting a clear and organized naming convention is essential. Common mistake: Missing wireframes and a messy project structure reflect a lack of planning and organization. Solution:  Stress the importance of wireframes and organized project structures in the README. Provide guidelines for creating wireframes and maintaining a logical folder organization.</li>
      <li>I also learnt that students are to create a detailed "Technologies Used" section in the README. Include all languages, frameworks, libraries, and tools used, with links and short explanations. Encourage listing additional tools, software, and rules for comprehensive documentation. </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Week 14 - Lottie</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>In Week 13, I learnt that Lottie, developed by Airbnb, is an open-source animation library that allows developers to seamlessly incorporate high-quality animations into web and mobile applications. At its core, Lottie is based on JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) files that encapsulate vector-based animations created in design tools like Adobe After Effects. This file format ensures a lightweight and scalable approach to animations, paving the way for a more engaging and interactive user experience.</li>
      <li>Also, i learnt that as I embrace Lottie within my HTML projects, the integration process proves to be remarkably straightforward and efficient. The library provides a bridge between designers and developers by enabling the use of animations created by designers without the need for extensive coding efforts. The JSON-based animations are easily embedded into HTML, and the Lottie library takes care of rendering them seamlessly across various devices and browsers.

        One of the notable features of Lottie in HTML is its platform-agnostic nature. The animations play consistently across different devices, offering a cohesive and uniform user experience. This aspect is particularly crucial in the diverse landscape of web development, where ensuring a consistent visual appeal is paramount.</li>
